        Graphing Complex Numbers
    </h1>
    <h2>
        To graph the complex number a + bi, re-write 'a' and 'b' as an ordered pair (a, b).<br><br>
        Do not include the variable 'i' when writing 'bi' as an ordered pair. Only include the coefficient.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Then plot the ordered pair on the coordinate plane. Since this coordinate plane is dealing with the plotting of an imaginary number, 'bi', it is now referred to as a Complex Plane instead of the coordinate plane, even though they work the same way. 
        <br><br>
        The x-axis is renamed as the "Real Number" axis while the y-axis is renamed the "Imaginary Number" axis.

    Example: Plot the complex number 3 + 2i<br><br>
    a = 3, b = 2<br><br>
    Ordered Pair (a, b) = (3, 2)<br><br>
    Plot the point (3, 2) by moving three spaces to the right of the origin and two spaces up.<br><br>
    Then put a point at that location on the Complex Plane.

    <h2>
    Example: Plot the complex number 5 - 4i<br><br>
    a = 5, b = -4<br><br>
    Ordered Pair (a, b) = (5, -4)<br><br>
    Plot the point (5, -4) by moving five spaces to the right of the origin and four spaces down.<br><br>
    Then put a point at that location on the Complex Plane.

    <p>
        Caution: If the complex number is not in Standard Form a + bi, then you must re-write the expression before assigning values to the ordered pair (a, b).
    </p>
    <h2>
    Example: Plot the complex number 3i + 6<br><br>
    Re-write it as: 6 + 3i<br><br>
    a = 6, b = 3<br><br>
    Ordered Pair (a, b) = (6, 3)<br><br>
    Plot the point (6, 3) by moving six spaces to the right of the origin and three spaces up.<br><br>
    Then put a point at that location on the Complex Plane.
